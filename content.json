Why NowWith the widespread use of mobile internet and smartphones, the term “blogger” seems to have become a footnote of the times. In 2024, there are already many mature writing and publishing platforms, and people might question why one would still need to spend time and effort to build and update their own blog. With the rapid development of the internet, we have more ways to express ourselves, yet it seems that the desire to express has diminished. Moments such as expressing emotions on social platforms like friends’ circles and Weibo appear to be the preferred choices. However, hindered by character limits and excessive social connections, we sometimes hesitate. Platforms like Zhihu and Jianshu seem too “professional” and may not be suitable for all content, and they are easily influenced by online public opinion. A personal blog becomes a more perfect choice. We can freely customize various modules of the blog according to our preferences. The process of tinkering and optimizing is like decorating a small house, full of a sense of accomplishment. Coupled with a personalized domain name, we can also build our own personal brand. Whether on social platforms or resumes, having our blog’s link is a good addition. More importantly, the content and data we publish on the blog belong to us. They won’t be lost if the platform shuts down, and we won’t have to endure the pain of massive migration. People who have experienced the censorship of articles and videos on platforms like Weibo and Bilibili have long started paying attention to the importance of data backup. Finally, we go back to the initial question: why now? While setting up NAS, I once deployed WordPress to write a blog, but it seemed to be under attack and was subsequently abandoned. Recently, I’ve been following Marina’s public account and was pushed to build a platform, so I shifted to Hexo + Github. Future PlansFirst of all, I will write tutorials related to Manjaro/Arch, TechJI’s adventurous tutorials, and study notes on machine learning. Secondly, there will be video tutorials and NAS/server tutorials that have been postponed for a long time… About LanguageAfter studying at JI for one year and a half, I have gradually adapted to the English environment. Tutorials written on TechJI are all in English. However, the blog may be in Chinese, English, or a mix of both, depending on my mood.","link":"/2024/01/15/Before-Everything-English-version/"},{"title":"Before Everything","text":"Beginning中文English 在开始整活之前想说的…… 为什么想做个人博客原因非常简单，想发学习笔记，想写教程,想记录那些有动力折腾的岁月。 为什么现在开始写博客随着移动互联网和智能手机的普及，”blogger”这个词似乎已经成为时代的注脚。在2024年，已经存在许多成熟的写作和发布平台，人们或许会质疑为什么仍然需要费时费力地搭建和更新自己的博客。随着互联网的迅猛发展，我们拥有了更多的表达途径，但似乎失去了表达的渴望。朋友圈、微博等似乎成为情感表达的首选之地，但受到字数限制和过多社交关系的困扰，我们有时望而却步；而像知乎、简书这样的平台则显得过于“专业”，不适用于所有内容，也容易受到网络舆论的左右。 而个人博客则成为一个更为完美的选择。我们可以按照自己的喜好自由定制博客的各个模块，折腾和优化的过程就如同装修一个小屋，充满成就感。搭配个性域名，还能打造自己的个人品牌，无论是在社交平台还是简历上，加上自己的个人网站链接都是一个不错的加分项。 更为重要的是，我们在博客上发布的内容和数据都属于我们自己，不会因平台关闭而失去所有数据，也不会经历大规模迁移的痛苦。曾经经历过微博、B站等平台和谐文章和视频的人们，早已开始关注数据备份的重要性。 最后，回到最初的问题：为什么现在开始写博客？在折腾NAS的时候部署过WorkPress来写博客，随后疑似遭到攻击遂作罢。近期关注了Marina的公众号，又被催着搭建平台，便转移到Hexo+Github。 未来想做的首先会写Manjaro/Arch相关的教程、TechJI的整活教程以及机器学习的学习笔记。其次会有拖更很久的视频教程和NAS/服务器教程…… 关于语言在密院学习了一年半，已经逐渐适应英语环境，在TechJI写的教程也全是英语。博客上可能是中文，可能是英语，可能是中英混搭，一切看心情。","link":"/2024/01/15/Before-Everything/"}],"tags":[],"categories":[],"pages":[{"title":"关于","text":"关于我一个在命运长河里挣扎的小鱼，00后，小白一枚。虽然前路迷茫，但是我会一步一步往前走。 关于主题主题参考了[Hexo - icarus](1. https://github.com/ppoffice/hexo-theme-icarus)的样式。","link":"/about/index.html"},{"title":"留言板","text":"","link":"/comment/index.html"},{"title":"分类","text":"","link":"/category/index.html"},{"title":"赞赏","text":"如果喜欢我的博客，或者喜欢我的博客主题，可以考虑赞赏一下哦，非常感激！网站所需的服务器和 CDN 都是不小的开支，日常维护也需要大量精力。 你们的支持是我前进的最大动力！","link":"/donate/index.html"},{"title":"友情链接","text":"欢迎各位朋友前来交换友链，本站友链接受以下类型的网站： 个人博客 公益组织等非盈利性网站 不接受广告、商业性网站，特殊情况除外 如果你的网站 一个月以上无法正常访问 将会被移除。","link":"/friend/index.html"},{"title":"标签","text":"","link":"/tag/index.html"}]}
