Before starting doing something crazy, there are a few things I'd like to say...

## Why Start a Personal Blog

The reason is straightforward: I want to share learning notes, write tutorials, and document those motivated and adventurous moments.

## Why Now

With the widespread use of mobile internet and smartphones, the term "blogger" seems to have become a footnote of the times. In 2024, there are already many mature writing and publishing platforms, and people might question why one would still need to spend time and effort to build and update their own blog. With the rapid development of the internet, we have more ways to express ourselves, yet it seems that the desire to express has diminished. Moments such as expressing emotions on social platforms like friends' circles and Weibo appear to be the preferred choices. However, hindered by character limits and excessive social connections, we sometimes hesitate. Platforms like Zhihu and Jianshu seem too "professional" and may not be suitable for all content, and they are easily influenced by online public opinion.

A personal blog becomes a more perfect choice. We can freely customize various modules of the blog according to our preferences. The process of tinkering and optimizing is like decorating a small house, full of a sense of accomplishment. Coupled with a personalized domain name, we can also build our own personal brand. Whether on social platforms or resumes, having our blog's link is a good addition.

More importantly, the content and data we publish on the blog belong to us. They won't be lost if the platform shuts down, and we won't have to endure the pain of massive migration. People who have experienced the censorship of articles and videos on platforms like Weibo and Bilibili have long started paying attention to the importance of data backup.

Finally, we go back to the initial question: why now? While setting up NAS, I once deployed WordPress to write a blog, but it seemed to be under attack and was subsequently abandoned. Recently, I've been following Marina's public account and was pushed to build a platform, so I shifted to Hexo + Github.

## Future Plans

First of all, I will write tutorials related to Manjaro/Arch, TechJI's adventurous tutorials, and study notes on machine learning. Secondly, there will be video tutorials and NAS/server tutorials that have been postponed for a long time...

## About Language

After studying at JI for one year and a half, I have gradually adapted to the English environment. Tutorials written on TechJI are all in English. However, the blog may be in Chinese, English, or a mix of both, depending on my mood.
